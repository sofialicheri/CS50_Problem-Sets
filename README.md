During the first week (week 0) of the online course, I learned the foundation of writing a code in Python:

Creating your first programs in Python;
Functions;
Bugs;
Variables;
Comments;
Pseudocode;
Strings;
Parameters;
Formatted Strings;
Integers;
Principles of readability;
Floats;
Creating your own functions; and
Return values.
